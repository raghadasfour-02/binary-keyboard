# A Binary Keyboard
Interactive Keyboard that responds to input from user's keyboard. 

---
### Inspiration
I saw a meme where a programmer was using a keyboard that consisted of 4 buttons: 0, 1, Enter, and Delete. While the meme reduced a programmer's job to essentially writing binary code all day, I found it to be funny and rather clever. Afterall, binary language is often taught as a part of our introductory computer science courses as a foundation to how computers work.

### What did I learn? [ABOUT PROGRAMMING]
- Spline; a design tool for 3D web browser experiences
- Integrating a Spline creation into a React app
- Configuring events that allow 3D keyboard to listen to user input and is interactive accordingly

### What's next? 
- Associating keyboard input with sound for a more user accessible experience for the visually impaired
